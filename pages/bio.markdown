I am a senior studying Mathematical Economics at the University of Pennsylvania.

I am a research assistant to Dr. Femida Handy of the School of Social Policy and Practice,
and I am also a Tutor at the Tutoring Center. Extracurricularly, I lead
Penn Cinema Initiative and build sets for Penn Singers Light Opera Company.


In July of 2020, I will be a Research Professional at the [Becker Friedman Institute
for Economics](https://bfi.uchicago.edu) at the
[University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu).


I aspire to advance methodological scholarship in causal inference and
apply cutting-edge techniques in machine learning and data science
to the social sciences, particularly education.
