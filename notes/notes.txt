### TO-DO
* add a research statement
	* acknowledge this is a working document. I am still young so I have yet to review all the necessary literature to publish such a statement with any semblance of finality. And I will likely change all my interests.
	* application interests
		* economics: microeconometrics, decision-making, matching theory
		* education: incentive design, curriculum design, pedagogical evaluation
	* methodological interests
		* I am interested in the logistical undertakings of field experiments and research design
 		* I am interested in the challenge of teasing causality in observational studies
		* I am interested in conducting research not only in interdisciplinary subjects but also in an interdisciplinary way
		* reproducibility
		* transparency
		* honesty
* research synopsis
* add a teaching philosophy
  * do i really need a whole page for teaching yet?
* add a page for coursework
* update bio
* potentially add miscellaneous page: e.g., my art and musical experiences
